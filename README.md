# Coding Practice 
Basic coding practice repository that i should have created long time ago. </br></br>
<b>Note : </b> Simple Repository i created to keep myself motivated and learn and grow by writing atleast one code (Simple or Difficult or an Entire New Algorithm) </br></br>
<b>About : </b>All codes are in Code_file and are written and tested in Java. It also contains pdf files (Articles I Wrote) for few Tech Websites explaining few concepts in detail.</br> </br><b>(if you find a bug please tag and if you want to improve code by reducing time complexity, please fork and pull request).  </b>
